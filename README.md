# Godot 20 Games challenge

In this repo I will be saving my progress in the 20 games challenge trying to learn game development in Godot. I started on the 2nd of December 2025 and hopefully will be able to get all the games done around the end of February.

# Current progress

## Pong

The first game I decided to make was pong. The objective I had while building this game was to get used to the game engine and to start developing the first intuition of how the nodes interact with each other and how to make a proper script.

- Development Time: approximately 4 hours.

## Breakout

The second game in the list was Breakout. It was very similar to pong so the development time was much shorter but I tried to add more stuff like a way to reset the game and some sfx.

- Development Time: less then 2 hours.
