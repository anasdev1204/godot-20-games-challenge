# Godot 20 Games challenge

In this repo I will be saving my progress in the 20 games challenge trying to learn game development in Godot. I started on the 2nd of December 2025 and hopefully will be able to get all the games done around the end of February.

# Current progress

## Pong

The first game I decided to make was pong. The objective I had while building this game was to get used to the game engine and to start developing the first intuition of how the nodes interact with each other and how to make a proper script.

- Development Time: approximately 4 hours.

## Breakout

The second game in the list was Breakout. It was very similar to pong so the development time was much shorter but I tried to add more stuff like a way to reset the game and some sfx.

- Development Time: less then 2 hours.

## Pacman

The third game I decided to make was pacman. I have decided to go with it since it seemed a better challenge than what else was on the list. I tried making the assets on asperite but it took too much time for a mid result so I [used these assets from itch.io](https://checkpointcafe.itch.io/pacman-practice-assets). It was fun to make and learned how to use tilemaps and signals more effectively. Have not done the pathfinding part because I figured it would take too much time for a very specific use case that I probably won't ever use again.

- Development Time: about 4 hours.

## Asteroid

The fourth game was Asteroid. Making this one was way simpler as I got used to the engine and to how the overall development logic is. It was however a new experience to experiment with infinite maps and shooting projectiles. The game is definetly not polished but I feel like the remaining parts to cover are not that challenging to do. [Used these backgrounds](https://virusystem.itch.io/background-space) and [these assets from itch](https://mattwalkden.itch.io/lunar-battle-pack) .

- Development Time: between 3 and 4 hours.
